        <!-- brief information -->
        <pre><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> 
( 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an
<em>Indian aerospace scientist</em> and <em>statesman</em> who served 
as the <em>11th president of India</em> from 2002 to 2007. 
Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram,
Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace 
engineering. He spent the next four decades as a 
scientist and science administrator, mainly at the 
<strong>Defence Research and Development Organisation 
(DRDO)</strong> and <strong>Indian Space Research Organisation 
(ISRO)</strong> and was intimately involved in India's 
civilian space programme and military missile 
development efforts. He thus came to be known as 
the <strong>Missile Man of India</strong> for his work on the 
development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
technology. He also played a pivotal 
organisational, technical, and political role in
India's <em>Pokhran-II nuclear tests</em> in 1998, the 
first since the original nuclear test by India in
1974.</pre>

    <pre>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002
with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata 
Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.
Widely referred to as the <strong>People's President</strong>, he
returned to his civilian life of education, writing and 
public service after a single term. He was a recipient 
of several prestigious awards, including the <em>Bharat
Ratna</em>, India's highest civilian honour.</pre>
